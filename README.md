# Firebase Asynchronous Data Race Condition

This repository demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data synchronization and race conditions.  The provided code shows how asynchronous operations can lead to inconsistent data reads and updates if not handled properly. The solution provides a corrected approach using transactions or promises to ensure data consistency.

## Bug Description

Asynchronous operations in Firebase (like reading and writing data) can sometimes lead to race conditions. If one operation reads data before another operation writes it, the read may obtain outdated information, causing inconsistencies. The `bug.js` file demonstrates this issue.
